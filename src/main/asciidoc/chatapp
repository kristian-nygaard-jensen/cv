Dear [Contact Person's Name],

With over 20 years of experience in software development – the last eight years focused on infrastructure and cloud solutions – I am excited to apply for the position of Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at Trackman. Your passion for combining cutting-edge technology with sports and innovation aligns perfectly with my ambition to build robust and scalable systems, all grounded in a strong Linux foundation.

As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I bring a wealth of experience in designing and implementing cloud infrastructure. My expertise includes a broad range of technologies and responsibilities, such as:

    Kubernetes and container-based systems: Implementing shared services and orchestrating solutions for the Danish Ministry of Taxation and other complex organizations.
    Automation and Infrastructure-as-Code: Utilizing Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins to enable efficient operations and continuous integration.
    Virtualization: Two years of intensive work with KVM for on-premises cloud solutions.
    IT Security and Logging Infrastructure: Deploying security and monitoring solutions with Rancher, Fluent Stack, and Terraform.

I excel at solving complex challenges and collaborating across cross-functional teams. My projects have included tasks ranging from setting up comprehensive logging infrastructures to automating deployment processes—always with a focus on reliability, scalability, and security.

I am particularly drawn to Trackman’s innovative approach and global impact in sports technology. As a dedicated Linux enthusiast, I am eager to contribute to your next-generation operations platform and join a team that values collaboration and technical excellence.

I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience align with Trackman’s goals. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can provide further details about my qualifications.
